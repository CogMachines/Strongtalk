This code is currently unused.  
Unlike Smalltalk, super calls in Newspeak cannot be statically bound.
Hence, we cannot use the Squeak VM's  super send byte codes. Currently, super sends are rewritten into a complex call structure by the rewriter, to ensure the correct binding of super.

When the Newspeak VM is modified to support dynamic binding of super sends, we will probably use this node and allied code,  which can easily be processed by the byte code compiler and code generator.! !
