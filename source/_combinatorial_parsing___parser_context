This class defines a context that is shared among a set of combinatorial parsers during a parse. The context can be used to manage information on parsing errors: rather than always report the latest failure that occurred, we can report the one that occurred deepest in the input stream, or implement some other policy - as long as we can record what failures took place.

In addition, this class could be used to support context-sensitive parsing.
