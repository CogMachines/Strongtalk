Class NewspeakObject is the root of the object hierarchy in the Newspeak programming language, and provides behavior common to all objects.

For each protocol P in the system, this class provides a method "isP" which answers true if and only if the receiver is an instance of a class which implements the protocol P.

Discussion:

Unlike other systems inspired by Smalltalk, the number of methods in this class is deliberately kept to a minimum. Behavior should only be provided by this class if it should be considered part of the core set of features available to *all* Newspeak programmers.

The security model of the Newspeak programming language is based on capabilities and it is essential that capabilities cannot leak through behavior provided by this class. For example, this class provides no mechanism for accessing instance variables of its instances. Instead such capabilities are provided to the debugger and other tools through mirror based reflection modules.
