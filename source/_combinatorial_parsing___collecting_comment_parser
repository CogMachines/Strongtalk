A special parser used for inputs that need to be rapidly scanned over. It differs from its superclass in that it actually collects the characters it scans, in case they are needed (e.g., for pretty printers). 

Ideally,we should not have to do this, but until we do proper optimization by compiling combinators, this will have to suffice. It provides a marked improvement in performance, By using such parsers for comments, whitespace and strings, the overall performance of the Newqueak parser improved by a factor of 2 or so.! !
