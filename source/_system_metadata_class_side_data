This class serves as the root of the class hierarchy representing Newspeak system metadata - metadata needed by the system itself. All this class does is:

a.  Cache an NS2 parser in a class instance variable, to avoid recomputing it (and hence the grammar) all the time.  When we fully convert to NS2, we can store it in a module variable.

b. Maintain a weak set of classes in the class variable weakSubclasses. This is used to track the subclasses of a class without producing a memory leak, which the normal Squeak implementation tends to do.
