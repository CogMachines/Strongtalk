*** EXPERIMENTAL/WORK IN PROGRESS: This code is not yet used by the core system, and may be significantly revised or removed *** This module implements and manages Abilities. Abilities are low-level input event interpreters that translate sequences of events such as mouse presse, releases and moves, into higher-level gestures such as button clicks and drag attempts.
